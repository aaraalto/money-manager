**Introducing Radiant: The Financial Tool That Helps You Face Your Numbers Without the Fear**

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA** — Money is emotional. For too many of us, checking a bank balance or looking at a credit card statement triggers a fight-or-flight response. We built **Radiant** to change that relationship. Radiant is a new kind of personal finance tool designed to give you clear "financial lenses" to view your money, empowering you to stop avoiding your debt and start designing your future.

Most financial apps are just glorified spreadsheets. They tell you what you spent, but they don't tell you what it *means*. Radiant is different. We believe that you can't fix what you can't see, so we built a system that illuminates the dark corners of your finances—specifically those scary APRs and "phantom expenses" that eat away at your hard-earned income.

**"We wanted to build something that didn't just shame you for buying a coffee,"** says the team behind Radiant. **"The real problem isn't the latte; it's the 25% APR on a credit card balance that's been sitting there for two years. Radiant helps you see that clearly so you can attack it."**

### Seeing Your Money Through New Lenses

Radiant moves beyond simple budgeting by offering distinct "lenses" to view your financial health:

*   **The Truth Lens (Net Worth):** A judgment-free snapshot of where you actually stand. It separates your liquid cash from your total assets, showing you exactly how much "runway" you have if your income stopped today.
*   **The Debt Freedom Lens:** APRs are designed to be confusing. Radiant strips away the complexity and shows you the math behind your debt. It helps you visualize strategies like the "Avalanche Method" to pay off toxic, high-interest debt first, potentially saving you thousands in interest.
*   **The Growth Lens:** Once you stop the bleeding, Radiant helps you look forward. Our wealth trajectory tools show you the power of compound growth, turning "saving" from a chore into a strategy for freedom.

### Taking Back Control

The core inspiration for Radiant is simple: **Don't be a victim to the system.** Untracked expenses and high interest rates are the silent killers of wealth. By bringing these numbers into the light, Radiant turns a scary monster into a manageable math problem.

We're not here to tell you to live a boring life. We're here to help you automate the boring stuff—the debt payoff, the savings rates—so you can get back to living your rich life, whatever that looks like for you.
