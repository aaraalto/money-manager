# Design Principles: The Radiant Ethos

**Persona:** "The Empathetic Architect"
**Inspiration:** Apple (Clarity), Cash App (Simplicity), Headspace (Calm).

## 1. Core Values

### A. Radical Clarity
Financial data is often noisy. We signal, we don't noise.
*   **Rule:** Never show a number without context.
*   **Bad:** "Debt: $45,000"
*   **Good:** "Debt: $45,000. Payoff Date: March 2026."

### B. Positive Reinforcement
Money is emotional and often shameful. We counter this with aggressive positivity.
*   **Rule:** Every action gets a reaction.
*   **Interaction:** When a user logs a payment, the app should celebrate (haptic feedback, subtle animation).
*   **Copy:** Use "Affirmation" language.
    *   *Instead of:* "You are over budget."
    *   *Try:* "Let's adjust the plan to get back on track."

### C. Progressive Disclosure
Don't overwhelm the user with the entire dashboard at once.
*   **Rule:** Only show tools relevant to the current **Stage of Wealth**.
*   **Example:** A user in debt (Level 1) should not see "Stock Market Trends" (Level 4). It is a distraction.

## 2. Typography & Visuals

*   **Font:** Inter / Outfit (Clean, Sans-Serif, High Legibility).
*   **Colors:**
    *   **Primary:** Deep Space Blue (Trust, Calm).
    *   **Action:** Electric Green (Growth, Success).
    *   **Alert:** Warm Amber (Caution, not Alarm). Avoid aggressive Reds.
*   **Iconography:** Simple, rounded strokes. 2px stroke width.

## 3. Copywriting Guidelines

1.  **Be Concise:** Remove auxiliary words. "Tap to save" > "You can tap here to save".
2.  **Be Human:** Talk like a supportive friend, not a bank.
3.  **No Jargon:** "Liquidity" -> "Cash on Hand". "Liabilities" -> "Debts".
